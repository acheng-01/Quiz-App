## Overview
The Quiz App is a simple web application that quizzes users on how well they know anything about cars.

This was my first mini application from the Thinkful Bootcamp, which is created with only HTML, CSS, and Javascript. jQuery is used as the library.

## Limitations
Functionally speaking, this application does everything one would expect a quick quiz app to do. It cycles through questions and keeps track of points. If anything could be improved, it would be stylistic (i.e. keeping all the question cards and answer boxes the same size instead of constantly changing).

A randomize sorting feature might also be implemented for retakers so that they are not blindly memorizing where correct multiple choice answer is.

## Usage
1. Click 'BEGIN'.
2. Pick an answer for each question and cycle through until the end.
3. Restart the quiz or just exit the tab as desired.

## Local Install and Run Guide

1. Fork this repository over and download it either with git or by zip.
